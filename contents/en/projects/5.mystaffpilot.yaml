    Therefore, we have a platform
    that meets our requirements as of today.

      Staffpilot GmbH provides a portal for agencies with promotions. This enables the handling of promotion orders for the agency side as well as for the self-employed a great all-round service.

      In close cooperation with Staffpilot GmbH we developed the promoter platform MYSTAFFPILOT. Since then, we have been maintaining and expanding this platform.The developed solution includes a public Android and iOS app, a web portal for promoters, as well as an internal application. This makes it possible to fully cover the extensive processes: from the recruitment process of future promoters to appointment management of all orders and deployed personnel, to invoicing. Several thousand users use the system on a regular basis.

      The biggest challenge in this project is the mapping of existing and the development of new processes of the customer. Due to requirements and demands on the system, we are making more and more changes. As a result, we are constantly expanding the platform and equipping it with new functionalities. Data security is the top priority: different groups of people (promoters, office staff, customers of the customer) have access to the platform. Consequently, personal, private, public, and internal data are processed in the platform.

      The key factor for the successful design and implementation of the system is the close cooperation with the customer. Personal customer support by experienced project managers led to an individual, technical solution. The platform, which is completely customized to the customer's wishes, continues to allow for the constant expansion and integration of new as well as customized features.

      For the development of the backend of the platform, we rely on the established Django framework together with a PostgreSQL database. Thus, we perfectly cope with demands regarding data volumes, security and agile, continuous development. The frontend for end users consists of the MYSTAFFPILOT.de website and a native Android/iOS app. In-house staff works in the system with a modern single-page web application based on Ember.js.

      The fundamental component of the system is Cosworth, an export-functional reporting tool developed by anfema. Cosworth allows data to be processed outside the system, for example in accounting. Thanks to multiple test and staging servers, we develop and release regular updates without disrupting ongoing operations.
