      <h3>Assignment</h3>

      <p>Pingonaut is a newly founded company specialised in the sales of devices for positioning. Their first product
      is a locatable kids’ watch intended for children aged 5-10. Combined with specially developed (web) apps, the
      watch’s functions needed to be adapted to the age of its target group. It was anfema’s task to develop an app
      that enables the worried user to constantly keep in touch with their child via (voice) messages or voice calls
      and to (retrospectively) track their movement on a map. Using geofences, parents can define safe zones, will be
      notified via PUSH if their child enters or leaves such areas, and thus will stay updated on their child’s
      whereabouts.</p>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>

      <p>Pingonaut Kidswatch was our first-ever project to require the server backend to perform a flow of communication
      not only with the app, but also with the related hardware, or rather, firmware: Complex information requested from
      the Chinese-made watches needs to be accurately analysed, reliably processed and securely transferred.</p>

      <p>As the time of the project’s initiation was concurrent with the outset of the product development itself, our
      software development was exposed to dynamic prioritisation, frequent changes in requirements, tight deadlines and
      a limited budget. Furthermore, the project demanded the set out of the requirements linked to the sales of
      electronic products in Germany as well as the rather difficult communication with the hardware manufacturer in
      China.</p>

      <h3>Solution</h3>

      <p>Our team’s great adaptability, their wide range of knowledge, and their excellent analytical skills, all were
      decisive for the project’s success. In response to a highly uncertain market volume for the Kidswatch’s launch,
      anfema scaled the server system horizontally ensuring its trouble-free expansion at any given time. In addition,
      we automated the entire server deployment so as to enable the system’s roll out on any number of servers. As a
      result of in-depth research of diverse mobile phone providers’ specifications and their integration into our
      software, a fully functional microservices-based system could be integrated into the European market. The
      Pingonaut Kidswatch is distinguished by software made and hosted in Germany conforming to the standards and
      data privacy of German law.</p>

      <p>If it wasn’t for anfema, there wouldn’t be a Kidswatch. The concept they created is thought through right
      down to the last detail, the platform they developed doesn’t leave a single question unanswered and exceeds
      all expectations. Expressing gigantic know-how, unusual flexibility and unlimited dedication, anfema is
      definitely is one of the best agencies in the digital industry.</p>

      <h3>Technology</h3>

      <p>The Pingonaut Kids app was developed in native code for both iOS and Android. Its backend PostgreSQL database
      simultaneously serves as the micro services’ message broker. An inexpensive alternative to GoogleMaps, Mapbox
      provides a learning API which uses both radio cells and WLANs for positioning. Node.js simultaneously and steadily
      maintains numerous (all or part idle) connections without blocking.</p>
