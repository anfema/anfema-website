      Sportiness, driving pleasure and comfort - three attributes the premium car manufacturer BMW has always been renowned for. The latest edition of the BMW 7 Series takes luxury in the automotive area to a completely new level. We designed and developed an iPad app which appropriately presents the car’s innovative features. The app impresses with an extraordinary, intuitive operating concept, artistic perfection and integration of interactive media.

      The challenge with this application was to present the elegance, comfort and features of the vehicle in an understandable way. Due to the international nature of the product, multilingualism and support for layout variants for markets, such as the United Arab Emirates, were absolutely essential. Since the vehicle was still top secret during the app's development phase, secure data storage had to be ensured.
