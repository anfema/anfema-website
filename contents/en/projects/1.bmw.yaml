      <p>Sportiness, driving pleasure and comfort - three attributes the premium car manufacturer BMW has always been
      renowned for. The latest edition of the BMW 7 Series, however, takes luxury in the automotive area to a completely
      new level.</p>
      <p>anfema designed and developed an iPad app which aptly presents the car’s innovative features. The app
      impresses with an unusual, yet intuitive control concept, artistic perfection and the integration of interactive
      media, all of which convey the comfort and pleasure of the BMW 7 Series.</p>

      <p>The challenging part about the BMW 7 Series application was to comprehensibly present the elegance, comfort and features of the car. Given the product’s internationality, multilingualism and the support of layout variants for markets such as the United Arab Emirates are among the app’s essential features. As, throughout the app's development, the car itself was top secret, secure data management needed to be safeguarded at all times.</p>
