      <p>HR digitalization. A topic that has been gaining in popularity for years.</p>

      <p>The potential is enormous! In addition to an existing web application that vitually illustrates many processes, this is the reason for Audi to go one step further.In spring 2018 we started the HR-App project with a clear requirement: native development for iOS and Android. We accepted this challenge with enthusiasm and continuously developing the App together with Audi.</p>

      <p>Facts and figures are clearly in the foreground of this App. The more important it is to support and ease user flow through animations and page crossovers.</p>

      <p>Thus, the user quickly and easily realizes how deep he or she is in the information structure. Due to the constant development of the App it is even more important to set a focus on this. An App should not be a static view, but an experience that moves and connects!</p>

      <p>The challenge is to unify the user experience, user interface and development for iOS and Android. Initially planned as an application with a reduced functional scope, it is constantly growing in features. Get information, enter times, save preferences or make requests. In order to make these functions quickly and easily accessible, we are expanding the App together with the users. This simplifies workflows for the end user as well as for colleagues in the HR and finance departments.</p>

      <p>Based on an existing Audi concept, we started the technical implementation. Successively, we were able to convince the project team of Audi  with our concept expertise. We are increasingly focusing on native design and development standards. Thus we catch iOS and Android end users excellently. They appreciate familiar functionalities: Login with FaceID/TouchID, navigation or the use of "selection controls".</p>

      <p>This project consists of an iOS developed natively in Swift and a Kotlin developed Android App. We regularly adapt them to the latest language and framework versions. The Apps are based on a MVVM-based architecture and contain up-to-date source code documentation. This ensures that our Apps will continue to meet the high standards of Audi AG in the future. At all times in terms of performance and maintainability. This allows us to react flexibly and quickly to customer requirements.</p>
