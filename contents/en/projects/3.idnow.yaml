      <h3>Assignment</h3>

      <p>Deeming postal identity verification (“postident”) obsolete, the Munich-based Startup IDnow specialised in developing a digital solution that simplifies the extensive - and partially complicated - process. Using IDnow’s technology, the customer is, for example, spared a time-consuming trip to the post office. The online ident procedure is a secure, officially recognised and legal standard for identity verification. The user-friendly app and the specially developed SDK succeed in making identity and legitimation verification faster, more effective and available from anywhere.</p>

      <h3>Solution</h3>

      <p>Using a straightforward navigation concept, the user interface was implemented in a simple and well-arranged way, speeding up the identification process yet again. In order to provide future customers with the highest degree of integrability, core functions were developed as a software development kit. Thus, customers can easily integrate the digital identity verification process into their existing systems, allowing for direct use. In order to guarantee maximum data security, a combination of cross-platform and platform independent components was applied - among them code obfuscation, prevention of caching inputs and encryption of all API requests.</p>

      <h3>Technology</h3>

      <p>The apps and the software development kit were developed in native code for both Android and iOS. The video process itself is based on two technologies: While communication between the apps and the agents is implemented through WebSockets, the bidirectional audio and video transmission is facilitated by Icelink WebRTC.</p>
