      Die Apps und das Software Development Kit entwickelten wir nativ für Android und iOS. Die Kommunikation zwischen den Apps und den Agenten während des Videoprozesses realisierten wir mithilfe von WebSockets. Für die bidirektionale Audio- und Videoübertragung des Prozesses nutzen wir Icelink WebRTC.

      Our task in this project was to implement the online ident procedure in a user-friendly and platform independent way - for smartphones, tablets and desktops. Considering the system’s processing of sensitive data, it was a key requirement to ensure maximum data security.

      We implemented the user interface with an uncomplicated navigation concept. At the same time, we speeded up the identification process. We developed the core functionality as a software development kit. In order to offer future customers a high degree of integrability. Thus, customers can easily integrate the digital identity verification process into their existing systems, allowing for direct use. To guarantee the highest possible security, a combination of numerous platform-dependent and cross-platform components was applied. For example, "code obfuscation", the prevention of caching or reading of input and the encryption of all API requests.

      The apps and the software development kit were developed in native code for both Android and iOS. The video process itself is based on two technologies: The communication between the apps and the agents is implemented through WebSockets. The bidirectional audio and video transmission is facilitated by Icelink WebRTC.
