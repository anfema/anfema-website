      <p>A nationwide distribution network is not always easy to picture and contains numerous sensitive data. Our goal was to master this and thus make life easier for Paulaner's sales staff. Now they have an overview of all appointments, customer data, orders and much more. This challenging and exciting project started in spring 2017 and is still expanding today.</p>

      <p>Facts and figures are clearly in the foreground of this App. An icon set was developed for Paulaner to structure these data and facts. This allows the user to enter information efficiently and easily. In addition to their information character, they ease up the subject matter and are a feast for the eyes. Simple & smart!</p>

      <p>The user is in the foreground - this is one of our most important proclamations. It was especially important for this Paulaner project to put a maximum focus on the target group.  Thus we had an intensive conception phase, which has paid off successfully so far.

         The target group is not one of the so-called digital natives. They are characterized by a hands-on mentality and are often under time pressure. A high degree of intuitiveness is therefore our top priority. This and many more aspects we were able to work out when we were able to accompany the sales people in their daily business. This insight into their needs and interests gave us an enormous advantage during the concept phase.

         We were able to successfully master the challenge and are looking forward to receiving feedback to continuously improve and expand the project.</p>

      <p>A bullet that the app marks out: We rely on native design and development standards. We pay attention to actuality and constantly improve the functionality. What the target group knows from their private used software, they also appreciate in their working software.</p>

          Pictures say more than 1,000 words - or in this case it is the map view.
          To get a quick overview, Paulaner's sales staff benefit from various options:

          1. Different types of customers are differentiated by different icons

          2. The users immediately receive the most important data about the customer at a single point. At the same time a visit can be edited or started.

          3. The formation of clusters strengthens the overview and can be split if required or provide the main information in advance.

          Sales employees will rarely get this statement. Therefore the need to add several articles to the order grows. Since the product range is extensive, the search or the filter and sorting option can help. A quick overview of the article directly provides the most important information to convince the customer of a new variety.

          As with the map view, employees benefit from a visual view of sales figures. The target group can have an overview of the product variety displayed in a bar chart. Anyone interested in a yearly comparison between current and previous year is also served here. Whether this view includes the brands or also the variety of articles is up to the needs of the employee.
      - id: "four"
        pagination: "#4"
        subtitle: "360-degree customer overview"
        description: |
          The 360° view is one of the most important needs of our target group.
          Our customer presentation offers an overview list of contracts as well as a detailed view that leaves no questions unanswered.

      <p>This project is an iPad App developed natively in Swift. We regularly adapt it to the latest iOS versions. This data-centric App synchronises in several variants with a backend based on the Salesforce Cloud. An indexed database on the device ensures complete offline capability. Thanks to an optimized query, there is nothing to prevent data sorting and filter functions in offline mode. In addition, the raw data from Salesforce accumulated in the app can be displayed in diagrams. Based on the design language of iOS, we developed several components for the App's user interface.</p>
